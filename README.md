# Titanic Survival Prediction: Machine Learning Project

![Titanic](titanic.jpeg)

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This repository contains code and analysis for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using a logistic regression algorithm. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and insights from the passenger data that can help predict survival outcomes accurately.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** The dataset used for this project contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, and fare. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on these attributes.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical attributes. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the data distribution and relationships among variables.

- **Logistic Regression Model:** We chose the logistic regression algorithm, a fundamental binary classification method, to predict survival outcomes. The model learns from the dataset to assign probabilities of survival based on the passenger features.

- **Training and Evaluation:** The dataset was split into training and testing sets. The logistic regression model was trained on the training data and evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
